# VRCat Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 18/04/2025

VRCat ("we", "us", "our") is committed to safeguarding your privacy and complying with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and protect personal data when you use the VRCat Discord bot, which integrates with the VRChat platform.

## 1. Data We Collect

We collect and store only the following types of personal data:

Discord Information:
- Discord Server IDs
- Discord Channel IDs
- Discord User IDs of those who directly interact with the bot commands
- Discord Role IDs assigned within servers that interact with the bot

VRChat Information:
- VRChat User IDs associated with audit actions (kicks, bans, warnings)
- Audit Action IDs linked to specific moderation actions
- VRChat Group IDs for owners who utilise the bot
> Note: While we do not collect usernames, avatars, or profile content, user and group IDs can still be classified as personal data under UK GDPR.

We do not collect or process age-related data or attempt to determine users' ages. However, we acknowledge that some users interacting within VRChat may be under the age of 18.

## 2. Purpose of Data Collection

Your data is collected and used strictly for the following purposes:
- Providing moderation services (e.g., kicks, bans, warnings)
- Generating audit logs and maintaining records
- Delivering analytical insights on group and user activity, including:
  - Number of moderation actions (kicks, bans, warns) taken by staff members over a 4-week period
  - Average user count in VRChat instances over a 24-hour window across a month
  - Group join and leave activity tracking
  - Moderation history summaries displayed during moderation events (e.g., how many times a user has been warned, kicked, or banned outside the current group â€” without specifying group names or reasons)
- Enabling group and role management through Discord commands
## 3. Legal Basis for Processing Data
We rely on the following lawful bases for data processing:

Performance of a contract: Data is required to deliver services explicitly requested by group owners and moderators

- Legitimate interests: Ensuring platform safety, accountability, and the enhancement of our services
- Non-essential features, such as analytics or reporting, are processed under legitimate interests. Where future features require consent, we will obtain it explicitly.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

All personal data is stored securely on servers located in the UK or jurisdictions with equivalent data protection standards. We implement appropriate technical and organisational safeguards, including:

- Data encryption and secure storage
- Access controls and auditing
- Regular security assessments

## 5. Data Retention

We retain data only as long as necessary to provide services or to comply with legal obligations. Specific retention periods include:

- Moderation and audit data: Retained for up to 12 months, unless actively required for ongoing group management
- Inactive group data: Reviewed and purged after 6 months of inactivity
- Deletion requests: Honoured within 30 days of receipt, unless retention is required by law

We conduct periodic data reviews every 6 months to ensure data is not retained longer than necessary.



## 6. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share your data with third parties unless:

- Required by law or legal process
- Necessary to protect our rights, safety, or property
- Explicitly requested by you

## 7. Your Rights

Under UK GDPR, you have the right to:
- Access your personal data
- Correct inaccurate or incomplete data
- Request deletion of your data
- Restrict processing in specific circumstances
- Object to processing based on legitimate interests
- Receive a copy of your data in a portable format

To exercise your rights, please contact us using the details below. We respond to all valid data rights requests within 30 days and may require identity verification.

## 8. Age Restrictions
VRCat is intended for use by VRChat group owners and moderators aged 18 and above. To support this requirement, we are implementing an age verification system for group owners. This may involve either:

- Reviewing government-issued ID to confirm age (no ID details are stored beyond confirmation of eligibility), or
- Verifying that a user's VRChat account has completed the platform's age verification process indicating they are 18+

We do not knowingly collect or process personal data of individuals under 18.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant updates will be communicated via Discord announcements or direct messages. We encourage users to review the policy periodically.
