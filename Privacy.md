# VRCat Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 18/04/2025

VRCat (“we”, “us”, “our”) is a moderation and group management Discord bot that integrates with the VRChat platform. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use the bot.

VRCat is developed and maintained by an independent programmer based in the UK and acts as the Data Controller under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).


## 1. Data We Collect

We collect only the personal data necessary to deliver our moderation and group management features:


Discord Information:
- Discord Server IDs
- Discord Channel IDs
- Discord User IDs of those who directly interact with the bot commands
- Discord Role IDs assigned within servers that interact with the bot

VRChat Information:
- VRChat User IDs associated with audit actions (kicks, bans, warnings)
- Audit Action IDs linked to specific moderation actions
- VRChat Group IDs for owners who utilise the bot
> ⚠️ While usernames, avatars, and profiles are not collected, these unique identifiers may still qualify as personal data under UK GDPR.

## 2. How We Use Your Data
Your data is processed only to enable the bot’s core features:

- Carrying out moderation actions (warnings, kicks, bans)
- Generating audit logs linked to VRChat moderation
- Producing analytics (e.g. group trends, moderator activity)
- Allowing group owners to manage their servers and roles

Analytics Generation
- Weekly and monthly reports (if enabled by group owners)
- On-demand reports via command (by authorized moderators)

Message Content
We only process message content sent to channels explicitly designated for moderation commands. This includes kick, warn, or ban reasons. No Discord DMs or general messages are logged or stored.

We do not use your data for profiling, advertising, or automated decision-making.


## 3. Legal Basis for Processing Data
We process data under:

- Performance of a contract – to provide the requested moderation and group management functionality

- Legitimate interests – to maintain accountability and improve our services. A Legitimate Interests Assessment (LIA) has been conducted.

Where future features require consent, it will be explicitly requested and can be withdrawn at any time by opening a support ticket.
## 4. Data Storage and Security

All data is currently stored on self-hosted servers located in the UK. We do not use third-party cloud providers at this time.
Security measures include:

- Encryption at rest and in transit

- Role-based access control

- Secure logging

- Rate-limiting to prevent scraping or abuse

If we adopt third-party subprocessors in the future, they will be vetted for GDPR compliance and this policy will be updated.

In the event of a data breach, affected users and the UK ICO will be notified within 72 hours as required by law.


## 5. Data Retention

We retain data only as long as necessary:

- Moderation and audit logs: Up to 12 months, unless required for ongoing group management
- Inactive groups: Reviewed and purged after 6 months of inactivity
- Redacted logs: Group owners can request deletion of specific moderation entries
- Deletion requests: Processed within 30 days unless retention is required for legal reasons

Backups are purged as part of the deletion process.
> 🛑 Important: VRChat User IDs are controlled and continually issued by the VRChat platform. If a user wants their data to stop appearing in our system, they would need to delete their VRChat account. We cannot remove or prevent the re-entry of active platform user IDS.

## 6. Data Sharing and Subprocessors

We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.

We may disclose data only:

- To comply with legal obligations
- To protect the safety, rights, or property of others
- At the explicit request of the data subject

We may use subprocessors (e.g., cloud storage providers) in the future. Any subprocessors will process data under strict confidentiality agreements and GDPR-aligned terms.


## 7. Your Rights Under UK GDPR
You have the right to:

- Access your personal data
- Correct inaccurate or incomplete information
- Request deletion of your data (within limits described above)
- Restrict or object to certain types of processing
- Receive a copy of your data in a portable format

To exercise your rights, open a ticket in our support Discord server. We may request ID verification and will respond within 30 days.

## 8. Age Restrictions and Verification
VRCat is intended for users aged 18 and older.

- We do not process or store any government-issued IDs.

- VRChat offers an optional age verification system. If a user passes age verification, we may store a simple flag indicating this.
Only accounts that pass age verification are stored. If verification is revoked or missing, we do not store the user at all.

Until age verification is fully integrated, group owners are responsible for ensuring age compliance.

## 9. Shutdown and Data Portability
If the VRCat service is discontinued, group owners will be provided a complete CSV export of their data (logs, analytics, group settings). Instructions will be sent via Discord prior to shutdown.


## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant updates will be communicated via Discord announcements or direct messages. We encourage users to review the policy periodically.
