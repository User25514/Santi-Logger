# VRCat Terms of Service
Last Updated: 01/06/2025
> Age verification has been added to VR-Cat. Terms of Service changes to clarify how the verified status is used, stored, and configured by group owners.

Welcome to VRCat — a Discord bot designed to assist with moderation and group management within VRChat communities. By using VRCat, you agree to the following Terms of Service. Please read them carefully before proceeding.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By inviting, configuring, or interacting with VRCat, you affirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy. You must not use the bot if you do not agree to these terms.

Group owners and server administrators are solely responsible for ensuring their members are informed of and comply with these Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy when VRCat is deployed in their community.

## 2. Eligibility
VRCat is intended for individuals aged 18 and older. Group owners are solely responsible for ensuring age compliance within their respective communities. VRCat now supports account linking between Discord and VRChat for users who have passed VRChat’s third-party 18+ verification. VRCat stores only a verification flag and linked user IDs, and does not access or store any sensitive documents or personal details used in that verification process.

## 3. Definitions
- “Group Owner” refers to the verified owner of a VRChat Group or the owner of a Discord Server where VRCat is actively deployed.
- “User” includes any individual whose data is processed through the bot or who interacts with the bot, either directly or as a result of its moderation functions.
- “Content” refers to any data processed by the bot, including but not limited to moderation commands, actions, logs, and messages submitted through bot features.
- “Moderation Action” means any warning, kick, ban, or other disciplinary activity facilitated, executed or logged by VRCat.

## 4. Use of the Service
You may utilise VRCat solely for legitimate moderation and group management purposes in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws. Any unauthorised use is strictly prohibited. Unauthorised use includes but is not limited to, any use that violates Discord’s or VRChat’s terms of service.
Users may opt into account linking between Discord and VRChat accounts for age-restricted access features. Group owners may configure role or access conditions based on this verified link, but are solely responsible for enforcing local rules or platform content restrictions.


## 5. User Content and Limited License
Users retain ownership of all content they submit or that is processed through VRCat. By using the bot, you grant the developer a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to process your content solely for:

- Executing and logging moderation actions

- Maintaining audit trails for transparency and accountability

- Generating optional analytics (if enabled by group owners)

This license applies irrespective of direct user interaction, covering all scenarios where a user’s data is processed in the context of moderation, analytics, or audit logging.

## 6. Enforcement, Appeals, and Retention
Suspected violations of these Terms will be subject to internal investigation by the bot developer. Group owners will be notified of the investigation’s initiation. If misuse is confirmed, VRCat reserves the right to:

- Suspend or revoke user access

- Remove the bot from servers

- Terminate premium feature access

### Right to Appeal
Users may appeal enforcement decisions within 14 days of notification by submitting a ticket via the official Discord support server. Appeals will be reviewed within a reasonable timeframe. All appeal decisions are final unless otherwise stated.

### Evidence Retention
Relevant moderation logs and supporting data will be retained for a minimum of 30 days following enforcement to facilitate appeals and ensure procedural integrity.

## 7. Prohibited Conduct
The following behaviours are strictly prohibited:

- Reverse-engineering, cloning, or replicating VRCat
- Using the bot to harass, impersonate, or retaliate against others
- Abusing moderation tools for personal or malicious purposes
- Spamming bot commands or moderation logs
- Tampering with role or permission configurations
- Attempting unauthorised access to bot logs or functions
Any attempt to circumvent or exploit VRCat’s functionality, including automation, bot attacks, or unauthorised API access, are prohibited.

## 8. Hosting and Deployment Restrictions
VRCat is a closed-source and privately managed system.
Custom or private deployments of VRCat are not permitted. All instances are hosted and controlled solely by the developer.

## 9. Premium Features and Patreon
Premium features may be offered through Patreon subscriptions. All such features are governed by Patreon’s Terms of Service. VRCat does not directly issue refunds.

Access to premium features may be modified, revoked, or discontinued at any time at the developer’s discretion, subject to reasonable notice where practical.

## 10. External Integrations
VRCat may, in the future, support integrations with external tools or services (e.g., dashboards, third-party APIs, or VRChat’s age verification provider). These integrations will be clearly opt-in and subject to the limitations and protections outlined in the Privacy Policy. Current usage of VRChat’s 18+ verification API is limited to receiving a verification flag; no sensitive data is accessed or stored.

## 11. Liability Disclaimer
VRCat and all related services are provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, express or implied. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the developer disclaims all liability for:

- Loss or corruption of data
- Misuse of moderation actions
- Downtime due to Discord, VRChat, or server outages
- Unintended behaviour from improper configuration

VRCat is not liable for outages due to third-party service disruptions, natural events, or force majeure circumstances.

Group owners and server administrators are solely responsible for configuring bot permissions and role access within their environments, even if they request assistance from the bot developer.

## 12. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the bot developer from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from:

- Your use or misuse of VRCat

- Your violation of these Terms

- Any data you submit or process using the bot

- Actions taken using your server’s instance of VRCat

## 13. Content Takedown Requests
To report concerns related to content processed or stored by VRCat (including alleged copyright or privacy violations), please contact the developer through the official Discord support server. Requests must include sufficient detail to identify the issue and the affected parties.

## 14. Data Export Responsibility
If VRCat is discontinued or a group owner requests a data export, logs and settings may be provided in CSV format.
Group owners are responsible for safeguarding any data exported from VRCat. The developer is not liable for misuse of data after export.

## 15. Termination and Discontinuation
The developer may terminate or suspend access to VRCat at any time, for any reason, including violation of these Terms. In the event of a full-service shutdown, group owners will be offered a data export of logs and analytics in CSV format. In the event of termination for breach of these Terms, no data export guarantees will apply.

## 16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of UK courts.

## 17. Conflicts with Privacy Policy
In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the Privacy Policy, the Privacy Policy shall govern all data-related matters.

## 18. Survivability
The following sections shall survive termination or expiration of these Terms:
Sections 5 (User Content), 6 (Enforcement), 11 (Liability), 12 (Indemnification), 13 (Takedown Requests), 14 (Data Export), 16 (Jurisdiction), and 17 (Conflict Resolution).

## 19. Intent and Ethos
VRCat is designed to support responsible, transparent, and ethical community management within VRChat and Discord platforms. Its design and operation reflect a commitment to privacy, accountability, and professionalism. While we strive to maintain high standards, nothing in this section imposes additional legal obligations beyond those explicitly stated elsewhere in these Terms.

## 20. Updates to Terms
These Terms may be revised periodically. Substantive changes to these Terms will be announced via the official Discord server. Continued use of the bot constitutes acceptance of any updated terms.

## 21. Contact
