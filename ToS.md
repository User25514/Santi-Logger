# VRCat Terms of Service
Last Updated: 22/04/2025

Welcome to VRCat — a Discord bot designed to assist with moderation and group management within VRChat communities. By using VRCat, you agree to the following Terms of Service. Please read them carefully before proceeding.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By inviting, configuring, or interacting with VRCat, you affirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not use the bot.

Group owners are responsible for ensuring that their members are informed of these Terms and the Privacy Policy when using the bot in their server or group.

## 2. Eligibility
VRCat is intended for individuals aged 18 and older. Group owners are solely responsible for ensuring age compliance within their respective communities. VRCat does not independently verify user age, except when a VRChat-provided age verification flag is present.

## 3. Definitions
- “Group Owner” refers to the verified owner of a VRChat Group or the owner of a Discord Server where VRCat is actively deployed.
- “User” includes any individual whose data is processed through the bot or who interacts with the bot, either directly or as a result of its moderation functions.
- “Content” refers to any data processed by the bot, including but not limited to moderation commands, actions, logs, and messages submitted through bot features.
- “Moderation Action” includes warnings, kicks, bans, or other disciplinary actions facilitated and logged by VRCat.

## 4. Use of the Service
You may utilize VRCat solely for legitimate moderation and group management purposes in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws. Any unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.

## 5. User Content and Limited License
Users retain ownership of all content they submit or that is processed through VRCat. By using the bot, you grant the developer a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to process your content solely for:

- Executing and logging moderation actions

- Maintaining audit trails for transparency and accountability

- Generating optional analytics (if enabled by group owners)

This license applies regardless of whether a user interacts directly with the bot, provided their data is processed in a moderation context.

## 6. Enforcement, Appeals, and Retention
Suspected violations of these Terms will be subject to internal investigation by the bot developer. Group owners will be notified of the investigation’s initiation. If misuse is confirmed, VRCat reserves the right to:

- Suspend or revoke user access

- Remove the bot from servers

- Terminate premium feature access

### Right to Appeal
Users may appeal enforcement decisions within 14 days of notification by submitting a ticket via the official Discord support server. Appeals will be reviewed within a reasonable timeframe.

### Evidence Retention
Relevant moderation logs and supporting data will be retained for a minimum of 30 days following enforcement to facilitate appeals and ensure procedural integrity.

## 7. Prohibited Conduct
The following behaviors are strictly prohibited:

- Reverse-engineering, cloning, or replicating VRCat
- Using the bot to harass, impersonate, or retaliate against others
- Abusing moderation tools for personal or malicious purposes
- Spamming bot commands or moderation logs
- Tampering with role or permission configurations
- Attempting unauthorized access to bot logs or functions

## 8. Hosting and Deployment Restrictions
VRCat is a closed-source and privately managed system.
Custom or private deployments of VRCat are not permitted. All instances are hosted and controlled solely by the developer.

## 9. Premium Features and Patreon
Premium features may be offered through Patreon subscriptions. All such features are governed by Patreon’s Terms of Service. VRCat does not directly issue refunds.

Access to premium features may be modified, revoked, or discontinued at any time at the developer’s discretion.

## 10. External Integrations
VRCat may, in the future, support integrations with external tools or services (e.g., dashboards or third-party APIs). These integrations will be clearly opt-in and subject to the limitations and protections outlined in the Privacy Policy.

## 11. Liability Disclaimer
VRCat is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the developer disclaims all liability for:

- Loss or corruption of data
- Misuse of moderation actions
- Downtime due to Discord, VRChat, or server outages
- Unintended behavior from improper configuration

VRCat is not liable for outages due to third-party service disruptions, natural events, or force majeure circumstances.

Group owners and server administrators are solely responsible for configuring bot permissions and role access within their environments, even if they request assistance from the bot developer.

## 12. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the bot developer from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from:

- Your use or misuse of VRCat

- Your violation of these Terms

- Any data you submit or process using the bot

- Actions taken using your server’s instance of VRCat

## 13. Content Takedown Requests
To report concerns related to content processed or stored by VRCat (including alleged copyright or privacy violations), please contact the developer through the official Discord support server. Requests must include sufficient detail to identify the issue and the affected parties.

## 14. Data Export Responsibility
If VRCat is discontinued, or if a group owner requests a data export, logs and settings may be provided in CSV format.
Group owners are responsible for safeguarding any data exported from VRCat. The developer is not liable for misuse of data after export.

## 15. Termination and Discontinuation
The developer may terminate or suspend access to VRCat at any time, for any reason, including violation of these Terms. In the event of a full service shutdown, group owners will be offered a data export of logs and analytics in CSV format.

## 16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of UK courts.

## 17. Conflicts with Privacy Policy
In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the Privacy Policy, the Privacy Policy shall govern all data-related matters.

## 18. Survivability
The following sections shall survive termination or expiration of these Terms:
Sections 5 (User Content), 6 (Enforcement), 11 (Liability), 12 (Indemnification), 13 (Takedown Requests), 14 (Data Export), 16 (Jurisdiction), and 17 (Conflict Resolution).

## 19. Intent and Ethos
VRCat is designed to support responsible, transparent, and ethical community management within VRChat and Discord platforms. Its design and operation reflect a commitment to privacy, accountability, and professionalism.

## 20. Updates to Terms
These Terms may be revised periodically. Substantive changes will be announced via the official Discord server. Continued use of the bot constitutes acceptance of any updated terms.
